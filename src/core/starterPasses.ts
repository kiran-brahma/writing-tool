/**
 * The rule Passes that ship with Obelus. Each carries one `RuleConfig` field,
 * and that field is the whole rule: the engine runs the rules a pass configures,
 * so adding a pass here is adding data, not code. The Starter pack is the
 * read-only default; the Writer edits these lists and patterns in the app, and
 * the edits are persisted, so #10's restore action has a known-good pack to
 * restore to.
 *
 * ADR-0003 makes the mechanical tier free and offline, and the Writer's
 * overused words are the Writer's to name.
